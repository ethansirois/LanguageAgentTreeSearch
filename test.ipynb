      "The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined. To fix this, the return value of the `solveMathProblem` function should be assigned to a variable named `result` before the assertion. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. The issue is that the variable `result` is not defined in the function, but it is being used in the unit test. To fix this, the function should return the result directly without using an undefined variable. Therefore, the return statement should be `return float(arrangements)` instead of `return float(result)`. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError where the variable 'result' is not defined. To fix this, we need to replace 'result' with the function call solveMathProblem() in the assertion. This will ensure that the result of the function is checked for its type. The implementation failed the test because it does not define the variable `result` before using it in the assertion. To fix this, you need to calculate the actual solution to the math problem and assign it to the `result` variable before returning it. The implementation failed the test because it returns a variable `result` which is not defined. To fix this, we should return the result of the math problem calculation directly instead of using an undefined variable. The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined in the function scope. To fix this, you need to calculate the solution to the math problem and assign it to the `result` variable before returning it. The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined in the function. To resolve this, you need to define the variable `result` and assign it the value of the solution to the math problem before the assertion. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. The variable 'result' is not defined, but the test is checking for its type. To fix this, we need to replace 'result' with the function call solveMathProblem() in the test case. This will ensure that the test checks the type of the returned value from the function. The implementation failed the test because the variable `result` is not defined within the function, so the assertion `isinstance(result, float)` raises a NameError. To fix this, you need to calculate the actual solution to the math problem and assign it to the variable `result` before returning it. The implementation failed because the variable `result` is not defined in the function, leading to a NameError. To fix this, you need to calculate the solution to the math problem and assign it to the variable `result` before the assertion.

To resolve this, we need to replace 'result' with the function call solveMathProblem() in the test case. This will ensure that the test checks the type of the return value from the function. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError, as the variable \"result\" is not defined in the function. To resolve this issue, the function should return the result directly instead of using an undefined variable. The implementation failed the test because the variable `result` is not defined within the function, causing a NameError when the test tries to access it. To fix this, you need to calculate the actual solution to the math problem and assign it to the `result` variable before returning it. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. This is because the variable `result` is not defined in the function, and the assertion is checking for its type. To resolve this, the function should return a float value and the assertion should be updated to check the type of the returned value. The implementation failed the test case due to a NameError. The issue is that the variable `result` is not defined in the function, but it is being used in the test case. To resolve this, the function should return the result directly instead of using a variable, or the test case should use the function's return value directly for the assertion. The implementation failed because the variable `result` is not defined in the context of the unit test. The test is trying to check the type of `result` outside of the function, which is not accessible. To fix this, the type check should be performed inside the function and the result should be returned directly as a float. The implementation failed the test case where it checks if the result is a float. The issue in the implementation is that the variable \"result\" is not defined within the scope of the test. To fix this, the \"result\" variable should be defined within the scope of the test so that it can be checked for its type. The implementation failed the test because the variable \"result\" is not defined in the global scope, so the assertion cannot access it. To fix this, the variable \"result\" should be defined in the global scope so that it can be accessed by the test. The implementation failed the test because the variable `result` is not defined in the global scope, so it cannot be accessed outside the function. To fix this, the `result` variable should be returned from the function and then checked for its type in the unit test. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. The variable \"result\" is not defined within the scope of the unit test, leading to the NameError when the test tries to access it. To resolve this issue, the \"result\" variable should be returned from the function so that it can be accessed and tested in the unit test. The implementation failed the test because the variable `result` is not defined in the global scope, so it cannot be accessed outside the function. To fix this, you should return the result directly instead of storing it in a variable and then returning the variable. The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined in the function. To fix this, you need to replace `result` with `solveMathProblem()` in the test case.

To fix this, we need to return the result variable from the function and then check its type in the unit test. The implementation failed the test because the variable `result` is not defined in the global scope, and the test is trying to access it directly. To fix this, the variable `result` should be accessed by calling the `solveMathProblem` function and then checking its type. This will ensure that the variable is defined and accessible in the test. The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined in the function. To fix this, you should replace `result` with `solveMathProblem()` in the test case. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. The variable 'result' is not defined, but the function is returning 'ways'. To fix this, change 'result' to 'ways' in the test case.
