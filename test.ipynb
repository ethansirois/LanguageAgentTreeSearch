      "The implementation failed the test case because the variable `result` is not defined. To fix this, the return value of the `solveMathProblem` function should be assigned to a variable named `result` before the assertion. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError. The issue is that the variable `result` is not defined in the function, but it is being used in the unit test. To fix this, the function should return the result directly without using an undefined variable. Therefore, the return statement should be `return float(arrangements)` instead of `return float(result)`. The implementation failed the test due to a NameError where the variable 'result' is not defined. To fix this, we need to replace 'result' with the function call solveMathProblem() in the assertion. This will ensure that the result of the function is checked for its type. The implementation failed the test because it does not define the variable `result` before using it in the assertion. To fix this, you need to calculate the actual solution to the math problem and assign it to the `result` variable before returning it. The implementation failed the test because it returns a variable `result` which is not defined. To fix this, we should return the result of the math problem calculation directly instead of using an undefined variable.

To resolve this, the function should return the result directly instead of using a variable, or the test case should use the function's return value directly for the assertion. The implementation failed because the variable `result` is not defined in the context of the unit test. The test is trying to check the type of `result` outside of the function, which is not accessible.
